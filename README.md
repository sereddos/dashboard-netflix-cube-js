This example is about data visualization on dashboards. I used Ant Design of React, Cube.JS to retrieve data and PostgreSQL as a database. 

If you’re not familiar with Cube.JS yet, please visit [Cube JS Sample React app tutorial](https://cube.dev/blog/cubejs-open-source-dashboard-framework-ultimate-guide/) before continuing this tutorial.

As the start point I used a sample Cube.JS React app.

This is an example of how to render a layer based on [Netflix data](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows).
